# **Analysis-of-Auditory-fMRI-Images**
Pre-processing fMRI time-series data to analyze structural and functional brain networks to finally perform Graph Theoritical Analysis.
> Dataset Link -- [Raw functional and structural data](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/auditory/)

### Steps considered in Pre-processing using MATLAB :
1. Motion Correction & Realignment
2. Coregistration
3. Deformation
4. Spatial Normalization
5. Smoothening

Then we used AAL, MarsBaR to identify top 5 ROIs among 116 ROIs from left and right hemisphere of brain. At the end to perform Graph theoritic analysis, 
we find the Functional Connectivity network using Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient, 
clustering coefficient of each node, 
transitivity of the binary network 
and characteristic path length of the binary network.
