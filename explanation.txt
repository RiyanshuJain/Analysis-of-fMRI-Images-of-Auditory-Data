preprocessing - 
1. dummy scans
2. realignment for correction of movement artifacts
3. coregisteration between the structural and functional data to maximise mutual infor (checkreg between reference as mean fn image and source image as structural image)
4. segmentation of the structral image, create white and gray matter, bias-corrected str image, create deformation field contains 3 vlolumes to encode in x y z dirs. If the str and func data are aligned propoerly, this can be used to spatially normalise functional data.
5. normalise spatially normalise files will be created with prefix w
6. smoothing 

model specification, review, estimation
1. sepcify 1st level --> create design matrix, use of classical dir, design orthogonality
2. USe review functionality --> A degree of non-orthogonality or collinearity is indicated by the gray shading.
3. Estimate
4. Inference
5. COntrast manager
6. plot responses at a voxel
7. overlays - slices, sections, render
